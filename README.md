## Background

To develop advanced software for a server or web application, it's essential to master object-oriented principles and data structures. This project aims to showcase proficiency in these areas.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the ability to develop a simple console application using Java, leveraging object-oriented programming, data structures, and clean code practices. Additionally, the project aims to exhibit competence in working within a Linux environment and using standard Java application servers and IDEs.

## Project Description

This console application manages a list of users.  It consists of two main classes: `User` and `UserList`.
it provides below functionalities.

1. Add User
2. Remove User
3. Search User by ID
4. Sort Users by Name
5. Display All Users
6. Exit

### Object-Oriented Analysis

- `User` class: Represents a user with attributes (id, name, email).
- `UserList` class: Manages a collection of `User` objects using an `ArrayList`. It includes methods for adding, removing, and retrieving users.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

- `UserList` implements a search function to efficiently find a user based on their ID.
- It also provides a sorting feature to arrange users based on their names.

### Java

The application is written in Java, which is a versatile and widely-used programming language.

### Development Tools

The project development was carried out using a popular Java IDE, [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

### Linux Environment

The application is designed to run in a Linux environment. Instructions for building and running the application on Linux can be found in the [Usage](#usage) section.

### Clean Code Principles

The code follows clean code principles, such as meaningful variable and method names, proper indentation, and clear comments. Object-oriented design principles, including encapsulation, are applied to maintain code organization and readability.

## Usage

To use this console application in a Linux environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or your preferred Java IDE.
3. Build the project.
4. Run the application.
5. Interact with the application to manage the list of users.
